# Password Hash Cracker

This Python script is designed to brute-force MD5 or SHA-256 hashed passwords. It generates passwords of increasing lengths and hashes them using the specified algorithm until a match is found.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the Python script (`password_cracker.py`).
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
5. Run the script by executing the command:

   ```bash
   python password_cracker.py

 Follow the on-screen prompts to choose the hashing algorithm (MD5 or SHA-256) and enter the corresponding hash value.
 The script will attempt to find the password by brute-forcing the hash. If successful, it will display the password.

#Requirements

    Python 3.x
